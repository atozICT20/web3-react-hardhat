## Before you get stared:

### Deploy Contract

In parent directory, deploy contract.

### Install MetaMask Extension on Your Browser

You'll need MetaMask installed to get this working. If you don't already have it, start by downloading & installing the MetaMask extension for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge: https://metamask.io/download.html (be careful to triple check the URL and ensure you are downloading from a trusted website). If you haven't set up MetaMask before, follow the instructions to set up an Ethereum account.

### Environment configurations

In this project, copy the .env.sample file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your chain name & id, your node URL (eg from Alchemy or Infura), and the deployed contract's address.
